In this step, I will guide everyone how to create **AWS CloudTrail** and **Amazon Athena**

- **AWS CloudTrail** records everything that happens in your AWS account, including changes to AWS resources, API access, and user activity. By tracking these logs, you can see who performed what action, when, and from where. This can help you resolve problems, detect suspicious activity, and comply with regulatory requirements.

- **Amazon Athena** is a serverless, interactive, big data query service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to easily analyze petabytes of data stored in Amazon S3 using standard SQL query language.
